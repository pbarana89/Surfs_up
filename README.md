# Overview of the Surfs Up Analysis Project
The goal of this project was to determine feasibility to open a surf shop that also sells ice cream in Oahu. Using temperature data from 2010 to 2017 I was able to gather that information to help identify how viable this project could be. I was able to use data from sql to extract and transform that data into readable DataFrames in Pandas and could if needed use the Flask library in Python to present this data in an easy to read format.

## Results of the Analysis

*  The temperatures for June shown above show a mean of almost 75 degrees Fahrenheit with a very small standard deviation. This is not only perfect surfing weather, but great ice cream weather!

* The temperatures for December shown above show a mean of almost 71 degrees Fahrenheit with another small standard deviation. This is great news because normally when people are thinking of cold things in December, they don't consider surfing or ice cream. In Oahu, you can still be out on the surf enjoying the waves and a cool treat.

* The biggest takeaway is the small difference between the two months. Normally surfing or ice cream is considered a "summer item", but with Oahu experiencing Summer temperatures all year long, a business that might only be viable for 6 months somewhere else can be viable all year round in Hawaii!

### Summary of the Project
The results of this project show the viability of opening the shop in Oahu. The information on the temperatures that we found using SQL and Pandas let us know we could open the shop all year and have demand year round. We would need to gather further information from the Datasets to let us know if we are in a rainy area. We could run queries from the data to determine the precipitation around the area and determine how often we would be able to get surf weather. We also could see if the information we have has a large number of data points in regards to other weather stations. We could perform queries to determine if our weather station doesn't have that much information or is providing a large number of weather data. Overall, based on temperature alone, it seems the shop would be very viable, but we can dig further to get more information through these other sources.
